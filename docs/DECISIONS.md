# Architectural Decisions (ADR-lite)

**SSOT for:** why key choices exist.  
Keep this lean. Add a record only when a decision will be re-argued later.

Format per entry: Context → Decision → Rejected (with Reason) → Consequences.

## ADR-001 — Authority instead of Revision / CandleSource FSM

**Context:** Multiple merge copies and volume drift (SQLite vs REST). Need one trust model for competing bar updates.

**Decision:** Ingress `Authority` levels (Estimated / Settled / Final). Higher Authority replaces wholly; equal Authority uses field heuristics (High/Low/Volume MAX, Close = incoming).

**Rejected:**
- Per-bar Revision counters — **Reason:** shotgun surgery; trust belongs in merge policy, not on every Kline field.
- Speculative candle-state FSMs — **Reason:** overengineering without a consumer (Rule 6).
- Per-exchange settlement registries — **Reason:** power plant; no second exchange consumer yet.

**Consequences:** One merge SSOT in `exchange/ingress.go`. Debt #19 closed. New bar producers must declare Authority, not fork merge logic.

## ADR-002 — Bar Source Seam

**Context:** Micro-candles and trade-synthesized bars polluted the ledger and chart path.

**Decision:** Only closed canonical `exchange.Kline` values enter the Ingress pipeline. How a producer aggregates (time / ticks / volume) is private. Forming ticks bypass Ingress.

**Rejected:**
- Re-synthesizing full rings on every request (old micro_candles) — **Reason:** expensive, non-canonical, hid holes.
- Silent hole-filling in the ledger — **Reason:** violates time honesty; a gap must stay a gap.

**Consequences:** Future `TickBarBuilder` (#44) plugs into the seam; tick TF menu entries remain sockets until then.

## ADR-003 — Boot: WebSocket first

**Context:** REST recovery before WS connect overwrote truth and raced with live ticks.

**Decision:** Boot FSM Connecting → Loading → Reconciling → Live. Buffer WS ticks first; one tick path `Runtime.routeTick` for live and replay.

**Rejected:**
- REST-as-truth during boot — **Reason:** REST lag loses to live WS Final Authority.
- Separate boot tick path in `main` — **Reason:** second pipeline; drift and missed invariants.

**Consequences:** Gap-fill/catch-up loops start only after Live.

---

## ADR-004 — Delete > Stub (Phase F)

**Context:** Legacy ScoreEngine / trade FSM / matrix / risk settings blocked a clean decision layer and confused AI/humans.

**Decision:** Delete dead strategy code. Keep thin sockets (`decision/score_types.go`, `execution/`, `falcon.go`, `vector_db/`). Default `ENGINE_MODE=ChartOnly`.

**Rejected:**
- Rebranding legacy modules in place — **Reason:** keeps lie-names and dead paths; Delete > Deprecate.
- Keeping stub engines "just in case" — **Reason:** false sockets; no consumer, high confusion cost.

**Consequences:** New strategies must be written against contracts in `decision/`, not revived `strategy/` implementations.

---

## ADR-005 — Vocabulary and package split (Phase G)

**Context:** Names `Marker` / `MasterGeneral` / `Layer2` / `Analyst` lied about responsibilities and invited wrong imports.

**Decision:** `Frame` + `Runtime` in `market/`; contracts in `decision/`; `strategy/` = `doc.go` beacon. Import DAG `exchange → market → decision → execution`.

**Rejected:**
- Keeping types in `strategy/` with new names only — **Reason:** package boundary still wrong; museum code invites revival.
- Allowing `decision → market` imports — **Reason:** breaks one-way DAG; contracts must stay pure.

**Consequences:** FE may keep `json:"marker"` label field; Go type `Marker` is banned.

## ADR-006 — Snapshot / Restore on streaming engines

**Context:** Intra-bar ticks poisoned IIR / oscillator state and caused history/live cliffs.

**Decision:** O(1) Snapshot/Restore around open-bar evaluation; save only on close. Double-commit guard via `lastCommittedOpenTime` (Core 4.8).

**Rejected:**
- Frontend tip clamping — **Reason:** duct tape; hides engine poison (Rule 1).
- Warmup-depth-only fixes after continuity tests — **Reason:** disproved; wrong root cause class.

**Consequences:** #67 awaits live confirm. ZigZag/geometry may remain repaint-by-design if documented.

---

## ADR-007 — Documentation split (Core 6.0 / 6.1)

**Context:** `MEMORY.md` mixed constitution, architecture, changelog, and debts → attention dilution and token waste.

**Decision:** Always-on = Protocol + Role. On-demand = Architecture / Open Debts / History / Decisions. Controlled English. `MEMORY.md` is an index; README is the landing page. Core 6.1 adds checklist, identity, when-not-refactor — inside existing SSOT files only.

**Rejected:**
- Eight overlapping docs (Principles/Glossary/Checklist as separate volumes) — **Reason:** docs power plant; duplicates Protocol/Architecture.
- Keeping full Protocol duplicated inside MEMORY — **Reason:** two sources of truth.
- Loading History on every task — **Reason:** attention dilution.

**Consequences:** Update the owning SSOT file only; do not copy facts across docs.

## ADR-008 — Timeline Publish Gate (not HealingManager)

**Context:** After Binance WS offline, FE Self-Healing reloaded GetWindow before missing closed bars were in `Frame`. Backend gap threshold `> 2×interval` false-negatived a 1-bar hole; `publishable` fired too early. Chart painted (and F5 kept) a hole.

**Decision:** Thin mid-session publish gate on `Runtime` — not an FSM/Manager.
`WS Connected ≠ History Reconciled ≠ Timeline Publishable`. On reconnect: forced REST tip fetch for all chart TFs → contiguous@1bar (`ΔOpen > 1×interval`) → flush pending → broadcast `timeline_publishable`. FE buffers until that signal (P1 status poll deferred).

**Rejected:**
- `HealingManager` / ReconnectFSM / RecoveryCoordinator — **Reason:** sockets, not power plants (Rule 6); BootController already covers cold start.
- FE REST merge of klines — **Reason:** frontend ≠ history SSOT (Rule 1).
- `loadDashboard` on every gap/reconnect hoping archive is full — **Reason:** symptom fix; GetWindow was still gappy.

**Consequences:** Debt #81 closed. Gap-branch of #67 addressed by heal+replay; continuous-session Live Confirm (#67) remains open. P1/P2 (status poll, GetWindow degraded) deferred.
