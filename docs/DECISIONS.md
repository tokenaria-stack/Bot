# Architectural Decisions (ADR-lite)

**SSOT for:** why key choices exist.  
Keep this lean. Add a record only when a decision will be re-argued later.

Format per entry: Context → Decision → Rejected → Consequences.

## ADR-001 — Authority instead of Revision / CandleSource FSM

**Context:** Multiple merge copies and volume drift (SQLite vs REST). Need one trust model for competing bar updates.

**Decision:** Ingress `Authority` levels (Estimated / Settled / Final). Higher Authority replaces wholly; equal Authority uses field heuristics (High/Low/Volume MAX, Close = incoming).

**Rejected:** Per-bar Revision counters; speculative candle-state FSMs; per-exchange settlement registries without consumers.

**Consequences:** One merge SSOT in `exchange/ingress.go`. Debt #19 closed. New bar producers must declare Authority, not fork merge logic.

---

## ADR-002 — Bar Source Seam

**Context:** Micro-candles and trade-synthesized bars polluted the ledger and chart path.

**Decision:** Only closed canonical `exchange.Kline` values enter the Ingress pipeline. How a producer aggregates (time / ticks / volume) is private. Forming ticks bypass Ingress.

**Rejected:** Re-synthesizing full rings on every request (old micro_candles). Silent hole-filling in the ledger.

**Consequences:** Future `TickBarBuilder` (#44) plugs into the seam; tick TF menu entries remain sockets until then.

## ADR-003 — Boot: WebSocket first

**Context:** REST recovery before WS connect overwrote truth and raced with live ticks.

**Decision:** Boot FSM Connecting → Loading → Reconciling → Live. Buffer WS ticks first; one tick path `Runtime.routeTick` for live and replay.

**Rejected:** REST-as-truth during boot; separate boot tick path in `main`.

**Consequences:** Gap-fill/catch-up loops start only after Live.

---

## ADR-004 — Delete > Stub (Phase F)

**Context:** Legacy ScoreEngine / trade FSM / matrix / risk settings blocked a clean decision layer and confused AI/humans.

**Decision:** Delete dead strategy code. Keep thin sockets (`decision/score_types.go`, `execution/`, `falcon.go`, `vector_db/`). Default `ENGINE_MODE=ChartOnly`.

**Rejected:** Rebranding legacy modules in place; keeping stub engines "just in case".

**Consequences:** New strategies must be written against contracts in `decision/`, not revived `strategy/` implementations.

---

## ADR-005 — Vocabulary and package split (Phase G)

**Context:** Names `Marker` / `MasterGeneral` / `Layer2` / `Analyst` lied about responsibilities and invited wrong imports.

**Decision:** `Frame` + `Runtime` in `market/`; contracts in `decision/`; `strategy/` = `doc.go` beacon. Import DAG `exchange → market → decision → execution`.

**Rejected:** Keeping types in `strategy/` with new names only; allowing `decision → market` imports.

**Consequences:** FE may keep `json:"marker"` label field; Go type `Marker` is banned.

---

## ADR-006 — Snapshot / Restore on streaming engines

**Context:** Intra-bar ticks poisoned IIR / oscillator state and caused history/live cliffs.

**Decision:** O(1) Snapshot/Restore around open-bar evaluation; save only on close. Double-commit guard via `lastCommittedOpenTime` (Core 4.8).

**Rejected:** Frontend tip clamping; deeper warmup-only fixes after continuity tests disproved depth asymmetry.

**Consequences:** #67 awaits live confirm. ZigZag/geometry may remain repaint-by-design if documented.

---

## ADR-007 — Documentation split (Core 6.0)

**Context:** `MEMORY.md` mixed constitution, architecture, changelog, and debts → attention dilution and token waste.

**Decision:** Always-on = Protocol + Role. On-demand = Architecture / Open Debts / History / Decisions. Controlled English. `MEMORY.md` becomes an index.

**Rejected:** Eight overlapping docs; keeping full Protocol duplicated inside MEMORY; loading History on every task.

**Consequences:** Update the owning SSOT file only; do not copy facts across docs.
